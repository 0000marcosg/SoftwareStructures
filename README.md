# SoftwareStructures

This is a new repository for code and ideas from 2004. 

This code explores the potential influences of Sol LeWitt's work on contemporary works of software. 
I created three example "software structures" to search for relationships. To further define the concept 
of software structures, I wrote and commissioned twenty-four implementations of these structures to isolate 
different aspects including interpretation, material, and process.

This repo includes code from Jared Tarbell (jaredtarbell), Robert Hodgin (flight404), William Ngan (williamngan), and Casey Reas (REAS).
