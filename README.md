# SoftwareStructures

This is a new repository for code and ideas from 2004. 

This code explores the potential influences of Sol LeWitt's work on contemporary works of software. 
I created three example "software structures" to search for relationships. To further define the concept 
of software structures, I wrote and commissioned twenty-four implementations of these structures to isolate 
different aspects including interpretation, material, and process.

Includes code from Jared Tarbell, Robert Hodgin (@flight404), and William Ngan.
